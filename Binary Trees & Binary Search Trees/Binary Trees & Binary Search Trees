1) What is Binary Search Tree?
Ans) In a binary search tree, the elements are arranged following a specific order. The rule is that the value of a left node must be smaller than its parent node, and the value of a right node must be greater than its parent node. This rule is repeated over and over again for the left and right parts of the tree,
starting from the main starting point called the root.

2) what are Binary Search Tree Operations?
Ans) 1. Insertion:
        Adding a new node with a given key value into the BST while maintaining the BST property.
        Compare the key value with the current node and traverse left or right until finding an appropriate spot to insert the new node.
2. Search
        Finding a specific key value within the BST.
        Start from the root node and compare the target key with the current node's key.
        Move left or right in the tree based on the comparison until finding a match or reaching a leaf node.
3. Deletion:
        Removing a node with a specific key value from the BST.
        Handle different scenarios: a node has no children, a node has one child, or a node has two children.
        Reorganize the tree while maintaining the BST property.


3)How many types of binary trees are there for example?
Ans) Full binary tree: Every parent node or an internal node has either exactly two children or no child nodes. Complete binary tree: All levels except the last one are full of nodes.
Degenerate binary tree: All the internal nodes have only one child.


4) What are the applications of binary tree?
Ans ) Binary Search Tree (BST) on the other hand, is a special form of Binary Tree data structure where each node has a comparable value, and smaller valued children attached to left and larger valued children attached to the right.
Thus, all BST's are Binary Tree however only some Binary Tree's may be also BST.

5) What are 2 types of binary tree representation?
Ans) Two common linear ways of representing binary tree in memory are array-based linearization and in-order linearization. Array-Based Linearization: In the linear representation of binary tree, the tree is linearized into an array by traversing it in a specific order,
such as level order or inorder
