1) what is Graphs and Graph Algorithms?
Ans) A Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It’s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, 
solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

2) Representations of Graph?
Ans) Here are the two most common ways to represent a graph :

a) Adjacency Matrix
b) Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of boolean (0’s and 1’s).
Adjacency List
An array of Lists is used to store edges between two vertices. The size of array is equal to the number of vertices (i.e, n). Each index in this array represents a specific vertex in the graph


3) Types of Graphs with Examples
Ans ) Undirected Graphs: A graph in which edges have no direction, i.e., the edges do not have arrows indicating the direction of traversal. Example: A social network graph where friendships are not directional.
Directed Graphs: A graph in which edges have a direction, i.e., the edges have arrows indicating the direction of traversal. Example: A web page graph where links between pages are directional.
Weighted Graphs: A graph in which edges have weights or costs associated with them. Example: A road network graph where the weights can represent the distance between two cities.
Unweighted Graphs: A graph in which edges have no weights or costs associated with them. Example: A social network graph where the edges represent friendships.
Complete Graphs: A graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex. Example: A tournament graph where every player plays against every other player.

4) Types of Graphs?
Ans)  Finite Graphs-  A graph is said to be finite if it has a finite number of vertices and a finite number of edges. A finite graph is a graph with a finite number of vertices and edges
      Infinite Graph: A graph is said to be infinite if it has an infinite number of vertices as well as an infinite number of edges. 
      Trivial Graph - A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge. A trivial graph is a graph with only one vertex and no edges

5) Basic Properties of a Graph?
Ans) Vertices (nodes): The points where edges meet in a graph are known as vertices or nodes. A vertex can represent a physical object, concept, or abstract entity.
Edges: The connections between vertices are known as edges. They can be undirected (bidirectional) or directed (unidirectional).
Weight: A weight can be assigned to an edge, representing the cost or distance between two vertices. A weighted graph is a graph where the edges have weights.
Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it. In a directed graph, the in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges that point to it, and the out-degree is the number of edges that start from it.
Path: A path is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. A simple path does not contain any repeated vertices or edges.
Cycle: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A simple cycle does not contain any repeated vertices or edges.
