(1) What is Recursion?
Ans) Recursion is an important programming technique that is used to solve many critical real-world problems.
     It makes the code compact but complex to understand.

(2) Any example for recurssion in java?
Ans) Recursion Example-Infinite times:
     public class RecursionExample {  
    static void p(){  
    System.out.println("hello");  
    p();  
    }  
  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
p();  
}  
}  

(3) WHat is fibonacci series in java?
Ans)  A Fibonacci series in Java is a sequence of numbers such that every third number is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers


(4) What is time complexity of recursive function?
Ans) The time complexity of recursion depends on the number of times the function calls itself. If a function calls itself two times then its time complexity is O(2 ^ N)
     if it calls three times then its time complexity is O(3 ^ N) and so on.
