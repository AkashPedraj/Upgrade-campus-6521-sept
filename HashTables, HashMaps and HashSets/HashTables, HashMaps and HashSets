1) HashSet Vs HashMap Vs HashTable In Java?
Ans) HashMap and Hashtable stores values in key-value pair. HashSet contains unique elements and HashMap, HashTable contains unique keys. Having these similarities they have some differences also.  

2) What is  HashSet ?
ANs) HashSet inherits AbstractSet class and implements Set interface. Set objects are always unique and no duplicate objects are allowed. One null key value is allowed.
The hashing mechanism is used to insert the objects into a HashSet.

3)  what is HashMap?
Ans) HashMap class in java, implements the map interface by using a HashTable. It inherits AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface. It represents a group of objects and every object will be in key-value pair form. It maintains no order for its elements. 
Duplicate key is not allowed. It can have only one null as key and multiple null as values


4) What is Hashtable?
Ans) Hashtable inherits Dictionary class and implements Map interface. Hashtable contains elements/objects/items in key-value pair and does not allow any duplicate key. It is Thread-Safe because of its synchronized nature. 
The null is not allowed for both key and value. The hashcode() method is used to find the position of the elements.

5)What is the difference between HashTable HashMap and HashSet?
Ans) HashMap and Hashtable stores values in key-value pair. HashSet contains unique elements and HashMap, HashTable contains unique keys.
