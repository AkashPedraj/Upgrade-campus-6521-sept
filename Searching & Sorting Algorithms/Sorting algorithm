1) What is Sorting?
Ans) A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 
The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

2) What is Bubble sort?
Ans) Bubble sort is a type of sorting algorithm you can use to arrange a set of values in ascending order

3) What is Selection sort?
Ans) Selection sort in java is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that is known for its simplicity over other sorting algorithms.

4) What is selection sort?
Ans) Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that allows for efficient, in-place sorting of the array, one element at a time.

5) What is insertion vs selection sort Java?
Ans) Insertion sort is more efficient than selection sort when the input array is partially sorted or almost sorted, while selection sort
performs better when the array is highly unsorted.
